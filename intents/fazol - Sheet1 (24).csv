"No, thank you."
Nope.
"Sorry, but no."
Not at this time.
I'm afraid not.
Negative.
No way.
Absolutely not.
"Unfortunately, no."
"Regrettably, no."
That's a negative.
I'll have to pass.
"No, I'm not interested."
No chance.
"No, not really."
"No, I can't do that."
"No, that won't work for me."
"No, I'm not available."
"No, I disagree."
"No, thanks for asking though."
