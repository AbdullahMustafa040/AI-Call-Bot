"Oh, I can hit you up with a confirmation later today, no sweat."
"I'll probably circle back by tomorrow, got to check a couple of things first."
Give me a couple of days; just need to sort out my schedule a bit.
I'm thinking by the end of this week. Just gotta double-check my plans.
Next week for sure. I'll have all my ducks in a row by then.
I should be good to go today. I'll shoot you a message after we hang up.
Tomorrow looks solid for me to confirm. I'll give you a buzz then.
"Let me take a couple of days to mull it over, but you'll hear from me soon."
"Planning to have an answer for you by Friday, latest."
I'm aiming for next week. Monday sound good to you?
I can lock it in today. Just need to check one quick thing after we're done.
Definitely by tomorrow. I'll give you a shout after lunchtime.
A couple of days tops. Need to chat with my partner first.
This week's looking good. I'll finalize everything and let you know.
Expect my confirmation early next week. How's that sound?
I'll be ready to confirm by today's end. Just got to run it by my team.
Tomorrow for sure. I'll have a clearer picture by then.
"Give me a couple of days. I'm pretty keen, just need to sort a few things."
I'll have a definitive answer for you by the end of this week.
"Next week, I promise. First thing, I'll get in touch with my decision."
