"Actually, it's something else on my plate that's got me hesitating."
"None of those, really. I've got another issue I'm trying to sort out first."
"It's a different hiccup for me, not really budget or schedule-related."
"To be honest, there's another factor at play here that's holding me back."
My main concern is something a bit different from what you mentioned.
"Actually, my hang-up is none of the above. It's a bit more unique to my situation."
It's something else entirely. I've got a different kind of constraint I'm dealing with.
My issue doesn't really fall into those categories. It's something else.
"Yeah, my roadblock is a different beast, not related to budget or topics."
"Actually, it's another concern that's got me on the fence at the moment."
"I'm facing a different challenge, not exactly the budget or the scheduling."
It's another thing entirely that's making me think twice.
"There's another piece to my puzzle here, not just the budget or topics."
"My predicament is a bit out of the ordinary, not covered by those options."
It's a separate issue that's keeping me from committing right now.
"None of those, to be frank. I'm juggling another ball here."
"It's an entirely different issue that's got me pausing, not those you mentioned."
"Actually, there's another consideration for me, outside of those aspects."
"My hesitation comes from a different area, not the usual suspects like budget."
It's a different sort of issue that I need to navigate before I can decide.
