"I’m afraid not, maybe next time."
"Not this time, but keep me posted."
"Sorry, I can’t make it."
"Unfortunately, that won’t work for me."
"I’ll pass, but thanks for offering."
"No thanks, I have other commitments."
"Regrettably, I won’t be able to attend."
I’m going to have to say no this time.
"Sadly, I have a lot on my plate right now."
"I appreciate the offer, but I can’t."
"I’m going to have to decline, but thank you."
"No can do, but maybe next time."
"I’m not able to, but keep me in mind for the future."
"I wish I could, but I can’t."
"I’m going to sit this one out, but thanks."
I’m afraid I’ll have to pass on this one.
"Sorry, but I won’t be able to make it."
"Unfortunately, I’m booked up."
I’m going to have to bow out of this one.
"I won’t be able to, but thanks for thinking of me."
