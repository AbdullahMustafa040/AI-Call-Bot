"No, I'm busy right now."
"Sorry, I don't have time at the moment."
"Can't talk now, maybe later."
"I'm in the middle of something, call me later."
Now's not a good time.
"I'm currently occupied, let's talk another time."
"No, can you call back later?"
This isn't a good time for me.
I'm not available to discuss this right now.
"Sorry, I'm tied up at the moment."
Can we do this some other time?
"Not right now, sorry."
I'm too busy to talk about this.
"No, maybe another day."
I don't have the time to discuss this now.
"Let's schedule this for later, I'm busy."
I can't spare any time right now.
"No, I have other commitments now."
"Sorry, can't talk about it currently."
I'm not free to discuss this at the moment.
